## Build process

In order to build you need [godot](https://godotengine.org/download/windows) (grab the 64bit Mono version).
(It needs to be added to the PATHâ€¯windows variable)

Then in git bash type the following:
```sh
./build.sh 
```
In the `build/` directory, you will find the resulting index.html.
